# Shumway Shim

A simple drop-in javascript which replaces Adobe Flash embeds with a [Shumway](http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/) viewer.

This shim can be used to fix old sites containing Adobe Flash movies. You probably do not want to use it for new sites.

## Usage

Download the latest version and upload it to your website. Then simply include the main JavaScript file on the page. 

```html
<script src="/shumway/shumway-shim.js"></script>
```
